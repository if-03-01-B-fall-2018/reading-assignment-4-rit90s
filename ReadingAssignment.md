# Assignment 5: Reading Assignment

## Objective
This week's assignment is to get you familiar with some more advanced topics of css like classes, ids, css box model, and floating.

## Materials
Review the [handout](AdvancedCssHandout.pdf) of the last lecture (what is basically a summary of the presentation shown) and check the resources as given in the following sections.

### Classes and IDs
- [Class selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asp)
- [ID selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.asp)

### Css Box Model
This is only one link to the [Css Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)

### Floating
Again only one [link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_float.asp)

## Required Tasks
1. Read the materials presented above.
- Add entries to your cheat sheet as you go along with the material to be read.
- Add the cheat sheet to your assignment repository and make a pull request.

We will do a quiz during one of the next lessons where you can prove that you read the given texts carefully.

## Evaluation
When you make a pull request your cheat sheet will be graded. Most common reasons to mark down a solution would be
- One or more of the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read

## Extra Credits
Give brief answers to the questions given in the file [SampleQuestions.md](SampleQuestions.md). When you make a pull request you will get feedback on your proposed answers and some extra points on the first quiz.
